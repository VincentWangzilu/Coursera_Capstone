    "## Introduction/Business Problem\n",
    "Car accidents happen everyday in cities. It is useful to predict the seveiry of accidents given information about the accidents such as the road condition, weather condition, and the collision type etc. In this project, we will be building a binary classifier to predict the severity of certain accidents.

This dataset contains features relative to car accidents such as the location, collision type, number of people involved in the accidents, weather condition, road condition and light condition etc. We have both numerical data and categorical data in this dataset. We will only select features of our interest to build the classificatino model. "
